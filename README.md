# Python ETL Project: Streamlining Data Processing

Welcome to the Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project repository! Here, you'll find the code and documentation for a comprehensive data processing project using Python. This project revolves around extracting data from diverse sources, transforming it to meet specific criteria, and loading it into a designated destination.

**Project Overview:**
The ETL process encompasses the following key stages:

Extraction: Data is sourced from multiple channels, including databases, data lakes, and APIs.
Data Quality Check: Rigorous checks are conducted on the extracted data to uphold its integrity and validity.
Transformation: Data undergoes transformation according to predefined rules and specifications. This entails merging datasets, computing new columns, and establishing lookup tables.
Loading: Processed data is loaded into the target destination, typically an Information Mart.
# Project Structure:
Extraction: Houses notebooks for extracting data from various sources.
Data Quality Check: Notebooks dedicated to performing data quality assessments on the extracted data.
Transformation: Notebooks for executing data transformations as per project requirements.
Modeling: Notebooks for modeling the data and generating visualizations.
